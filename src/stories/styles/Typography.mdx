<h1>Typography</h1>

<h2>Font</h2>
<p>If you want to create a new product using Astrea we suggest you to use Titillium Web as font.</p>
<p>
      Font type: <strong>Titillium Web</strong><br />
      Download font: <a style={{ color: '#2E5A60', textDecoration: 'underline' }} href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web">https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web</a><br />
      Designed by <a style={{ color: '#2E5A60', textDecoration: 'underline' }} href="https://www.accademiadiurbino.it/">Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino</a>
</p>

<h2>When not to use Titillium Web</h2>
<p>There are no real cases in which not to use the Titillium web as a font. If the use of a different font is explicitly requested, it can be customized directly within the UI-Kit. However, it is essential that the chosen font respects the accessibility guidelines of the design system itself.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>The "Typography" component makes it easy to apply a default set of font weights and sizes in your application.</p>

<p>
      H1<br />
      <h1>Heading<br /></h1>

<p>
      Body normal<br />
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec sodales mollis rhoncus. Aliquam erat volutpat. Donec odio diam, semper a nisi nec, eleifend feugiat enim. Aenean eu massa venenatis, feugiat eros sed, vulputate tortor. Aenean ante mauris, maximus ut egestas sit amet, fringilla a ipsum. Praesent sed gravida metus, vel lobortis odio. Pellentesque at suscipit lectus, at rhoncus orci. Maecenas non metus neque. Cras eu vehicula ex, et efficitur ante.<br />
      Size: 20px; weight: Bold; Color: #000000
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>Links are green and underlined by default. If your link is at the end of a sentence or paragraph, make sure that the linked text does not include the full stop.</p>

<p>
      Link<br />
      <a style={{ color: '#2E5A60', textDecoration: 'underline' }} >Read the documentation</a><br />
      Size: 20px; Color: #2E5A60; Style: Underlined;
</p>

<h2>External links</h2>
<p>If it’s an external link to a new context, make that clear in the link text. For example, ‘read advice on writing link text from [name of organisation]’. There’s no need to say explicitly that you’re linking to an external site.</p>

<h2>Opening links in a new tab</h2>
<p>Avoid opening links in a new tab or window. It can be disorienting - and can cause accessibility problems for people who cannot visually perceive that the new tab has opened.</p>
<p>If you need a link to open in a new tab - for example, to stop the user losing information they’ve entered into a form - then include the words ‘opens in new tab’ as part of the link. There’s no need to say ‘tab or window’, since opening in a new tab is the default behaviour for most browsers.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<h3>Heading hierarchy</h3>
<p>Headings communicate the organization of the content on the page. Web browsers, plug-ins, and assistive technologies can use them to provide in-page navigation.</p>
<p>Nest headings by their rank (or level). The most important heading has the rank 1 (`<h1>`), the least important heading rank 6 (`<h6>`). Headings with an equal or higher rank start a new section, headings with a lower rank start new subsections that are part of the higher ranked section.<br />
Skipping heading ranks can be confusing and should be avoided where possible: Make sure that a `<h2>` is not followed directly by an `<h4>`, for example. It is ok to skip ranks when closing subsections, for instance, a `<h2>` beginning a new section, can follow an `<h4>` as it closes the previous section.</p>

<h3>Best practices summarized</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use one unique h1 per page that describes what that page is about. That h1 preferably starts just above the main content.</li>
  <li>Use headings to describe the content below. Do not use an HTML heading just to make the text appear bigger or stand out.</li>
	<li>Use heading levels like the index of a book: hierarchical.</li>
	<li>Do not choose a heading by its size, but by its level in the context of the content.</li>
	<li>Do not skip a heading level from the top down.</li>
</ul>

<p>
      <h3>Screen reader navigation<br /></h3>
     People who are blind or visually impaired use a screen reader to read and navigate a website.
</p>
<p>With the screen reader you can jump from heading to heading, using a shortcode, and so scan the web page by headings. And you can call a list of headings and scroll through that, to choose the content you want to read from. This is a super fast way to get where you want to read when you can not see the content.</p>
<p>Heading navigation is very common. In the 2021 Screen Reader User Survey by WebAIM it shows that 67.7% use headings to find information. 85.7% of respondents find heading levels very or somewhat useful.</p>
<p>Write your headings and heading structure with that information in mind. Provide information about the content in the page with your headings, also for someone who can not see the page content.</p>

<p>
      <h3>Font size<br /></h3>
     Use relative units (rem) to accommodate the user's settings.
