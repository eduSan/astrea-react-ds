<h1>Modal</h1>
<p>
  The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, or whatever else.
</p>
<p>
  The background of an application resembles the flat, opaque texture of a sheet of paper, 
  and an application's behavior mimics paper's ability to be re-sized, shuffled, 
  and bound together in multiple sheets.
</p>

{/* <h3>Nested  modal</h3>

  or any two modals with a backdrop is <b>discouraged</b>.

<h3>Sidebar modal</h3>
<p>
  The lateral modal allows you to provide information without completely covering or obscuring the page. 
  The user can perform repeated actions without losing track of navigation.
