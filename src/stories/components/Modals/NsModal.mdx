<h1>Modal</h1>

  The modal component provides a solid foundation for creating dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, or whatever else.

  The background of an application resembles the flat, opaque texture of a sheet of paper, 
  and an application's behavior mimics paper's ability to be re-sized, shuffled, 
  and bound together in multiple sheets.


<h3>Basic modal</h3>

  This type of modal provides additional information but does not contain any additional action.

<Primary />
<Controls />

{/* <h3>Nested  modal</h3>
<p>
  Modals can be nested, for example a select within a dialog, but stacking of more than two modals, 
  or any two modals with a backdrop is <b>discouraged</b>.
</p> */}
<h3>Modale as a friction</h3>

  Example of a paragraph that contains information and details to take an action or reject it.

<Story  of={NsModal.ActionsModal} />

<h3>Sidebar modal</h3>

  The lateral modal allows you to provide information without completely covering or obscuring the page. 
  The user can perform repeated actions without losing track of navigation.

<h3>Fullscreen modal</h3>

  Modals can be nested, for example a select within a dialog, but stacking of more than two modals, 
  or any two modals with a backdrop is discouraged.
