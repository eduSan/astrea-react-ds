<h1>Panel</h1>

<p>
  The background of an application resembles the flat, opaque texture of a sheet of paper, 
  and an application's behavior mimics paper's ability to be re-sized, shuffled, 
  and bound together in multiple sheets.
</p>
<Primary />
<Controls/>
<p>
The panels serve to visually separate the components of the page and allow the user to visually 
recognize the individual macro areas. Unlike cards, they can be considered as containers 
for other components.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to give a weight to the single panels through the use of color as in the following example:
</p>
<Story of={NsPanel.BasicPanel}/>
<Story of={NsPanel.BasicPanelSecondary}/>


<h3>Menu panel </h3>
<Story of={NsPanel.MenuPanel}/>
