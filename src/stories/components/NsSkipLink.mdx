<h1>Skip Link</h1>
<p>
  This NsSkipLink component enhances accessibility by allowing users to navigate
  directly to essential content areas, improving the overall user experience,
  especially for keyboard and screen reader users. Adjust and customise as
  needed based on your specific project requirements and design guidelines.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<ol>
  <strong>
    <li>Tab Navigation:</li>
  </strong>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Users navigate through the page using the 'Tab' key, which moves the
      keyboard focus sequentially through focusable elements (links, buttons,
      form fields, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
      When the focus reaches the skip link (which is usually the first focusable
      element on the page), the user can activate it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>
    <li>Activation:</li>
  </strong>
  <ol>
    <li type="a">
      Once the skip link receives focus (after pressing the 'Tab' key), users
      can activate it by pressing the 'Enter' key or 'Spacebar'. This action
      will trigger the link to navigate or jump to the specified content area.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>
    <li>Focus Movement:</li>
  </strong>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      After activating the skip link, the focus will move to the target content
      area that the skip link is linked to (e.g., the main content section of
      the page).
    </li>
    <li>
      This allows users to bypass repetitive content, such as navigation menus
      or headers, and directly access the main content or other significant
      sections of the webpage.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <strong>
    <li>Accessibility Support:</li>
  </strong>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Keyboard accessibility is crucial for users who rely on assistive
      technologies like screen readers or for those who navigate the web without
      using a mouse or other pointing devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Skip links, when implemented and structured correctly, help these users
      bypass content and quickly access the essential sections of a web page.
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>
  In essence, the skip link is triggered by moving the keyboard focus to it
  using the 'Tab' key, then activating it with the 'Enter' key or 'Spacebar'.
  This allows users to efficiently navigate through the content of a webpage,
  especially when there is repetitive or non-essential content that they may
  want to skip.
</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Test the skip link to ensure it properly navigates users to the intended
    content area
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider styling to make the skip link visible when focused or hovered for
    improved usability.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Props</h3>
<Controls />
<ol>
  <li>
    href(required): ID of the element to which the skip link should navigate.
  </li>
  <li>children(required): Text displayed for the skip link.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  When implementing skip links or any other accessibility feature, there are
  several best practices and considerations to ensure a more inclusive and
  user-friendly experience. Ensure the targetId points to an element with
  meaningful content (like the main content area) for users who rely on
  assistive technologies. You may need to handle the styling to make the skip
  link visible to keyboard users and screen readers while remaining hidden from
  sighted users.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
  Place the &lt;NsSkipLink /&gt; component at the top of your page, typically
  before other content or navigation links. Set the targetId prop to the ID of
  the content area you want users to skip to (e.g., the main content section).
