<h1>Table</h1>

  Use the table component to make information easier to compare and scan for users.

  The `NsDataGrid` component provides a powerful, flexible grid system that can handle both 
  client-side and server-side data rendering. 
  This component is based on the `@tanstack/react-table` library, 
  offering advanced features such as pagination, sorting, filtering, and row selection.

  The `NsDataGrid` component offers flexibility for both client-side and server-side data rendering. 
  Whether you need server-side pagination for large datasets or client-side rendering for smaller data, 


<h3>Server data grid</h3>

  The `NsDataGrid` component in server-side mode fetches data from an external source and supports 
  server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering. It requires a `fetcher` function to load data.

<Controls/>

<h3>Client data grid</h3>
  The client-side mode directly renders data passed via the `data` prop. 
  All pagination, sorting, and filtering is handled locally.

<h3>Customization</h3>
<h4>Layout customization</h4>

  You can customize the grid layout by providing a `render` function. 
  The `render` function allows you to specify how the filter section, table, 
  and pager are laid out on the page.

```jsx
<NsDataGrid
  type="server"
  columns={columns}
  fetcher={fetcher}
  render={(FilterContainer, Table, Pager) => (
    <div>
      {FilterContainer}
      <div>{Table}</div>
      <div>{Pager}</div>
    </div>
  )}
/>;
``` 
<Story of={NsDataTable.ServerDataGridCustomLayout}/>
{/* <Controls of={NsDataTable.ServerDataGridCustomLayout}/> */}


<h4>Event Listeners</h4>

  To handle events such as row selection, filtering, or sorting changes, 
  you can provide an `eventListener` callback. 
  This allows you to perform actions based on user interaction with the grid.
  
```jsx
const handleEvent = (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'SELECTION_CHANGE') {
    console.log('Selected rows:', event.payload);
  }
};

<NsDataGrid
  type="client"
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  eventListener={handleEvent}
/>;
``` 


{/* <h3>Action dialog</h3>

<p>
  Example of a paragraph that contains information and details to take an action or reject it.
</p>
<p>
To prevent the dialog from closing when clicking outside of it, 
you need to pass a function that checks the received value. 
Example:
</p>
```jsx
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);
const handleClose = (value: any) => {
    if (value !== undefined) {
        setIsOpen(false);
    }
};
``` */}

{/* <p>
In this example, the 'handleClose' function ensures that the dialog will only close if a valid value is provided. 
This avoids unintended closures, such as when clicking outside the dialog.
</p>


<h3>Basic dialog</h3>
<p>
  This type of dialog provides additional information but does not contain any additional action.
</p> */}
{/* <Story of={NsDataTable.BasicModal}/>
<Controls of={NsDataTable.BasicModal}/> */}
{/* <Source of={NsDialog.BasicModal}/> */}
{/* <h3>Nested  dialog</h3>
<p>
  Dialogs can be nested, for example a select within a dialog, but stacking of more than two dialogs, 
  or any two dialogs with a backdrop is <b>discouraged</b>.
</p> */}


{/* <h3>Fullscreen dialog</h3>
<Story  of={NsDataTable.FullscreenModal} />
<Controls of={NsDataTable.FullscreenModal}/>
<h3>No action dialog</h3>
<p>
  Dialogs can be opened without the need for a button by directly setting the state that controls their 
  visibility to true. 
  This means that you can manage the dialog's open state programmatically by updating the state directly, 
  bypassing the need for user actions such as clicking a button. By controlling the open state in this manner, 
  you can programmatically display the dialog based on specific conditions or events within your application, 
  providing greater flexibility and control over its visibility.
