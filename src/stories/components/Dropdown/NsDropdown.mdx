<h1>Dropdown</h1>
<p>
  The Dropdown component is a reusable UI element used to present a list of
  selectable options in a collapsible menu. It allows users to choose a single
  option from the provided list
</p>
<Primary />

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
  The Dropdown component typically consists of a trigger element (such as a
  button, an icon or text) and a list of options that appear when the trigger is
  activated (clicked or hovered over). Users can select an option from the list,
  and the Dropdown collapses to display the chosen value in the trigger element.
</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Keep the list of options concise and relevant to the user's needs to avoid
    overwhelming them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide clear labeling and intuitive design for the trigger element to
    indicate its functionality.
  </li>
  <li>
    Test the Dropdown component across different devices and screen sizes to
    ensure responsiveness and consistent behavior.
  </li>
</ul>
