<h1>Pagination</h1>
<p>
  MUI already offers a Pagination component with a comprehensive API. 
  We should encourage our users to rely on the MUI component.
  In order to guarantee compliance with the Design System specification, 
  we should provida a custom PaginationActions implementation that follows the DS guidelines.
  See https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#custom-pagination-actions, 
  or the NsDataGrid pager implementation for reference.

<h3>When to use this component</h3>
<p>
  Consider using pagination when:
  <ul>
    <li>
      showing all the content on a single page makes the page take too long to load  
    </li>
    <li>
      most users will only need the content on the first page or first few pages
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>When not to use this component</h3>
<p>
  Only break up content onto separate pages if it improves the performance or usability of your service.
</p>
<p>
  Avoid using the ‘infinite scroll’ technique to automatically load content when the user approaches the 
  bottom of the page. This causes problems for keyboard users.
</p>
<p>
  Do not use this Pagination component for linear journeys — for example, where you’re asking the user to 
  complete a form. 
  Instead, use the Button component (usually a ‘Continue’ button) to let the user move to the next page — and a 
  Back link to let them move to the previous page.
