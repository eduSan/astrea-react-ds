<h1>File Upload</h1>

<h3>What is</h3>

  The File Upload component allows users to upload files as part of a form. It supports different types of files by configuring the accepted file formats.

<h3>How it works</h3>

  The File Upload component is based on MUI and allows users to select a file from their system. You can control the type of files accepted by passing the <code>inputProps</code> prop with an <code>accept</code> attribute, e.g., <code>{`accept: ".pdf,.eml"`}</code> to restrict uploads to PDFs and EML files.

<h3>Example with Type and Accepted Files</h3>

  In the following example, the file input is restricted to only accept PDFs and EML files using the <code>accept</code> attribute in <code>inputProps</code>.

<Primary name="FileUploadWithAccept" />

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use <code>type="file"</code> to ensure the input element behaves as a file input.
  </li>
  <li>
    Define <code>inputProps</code> with the <code>accept</code> attribute to restrict the file types that can be uploaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Handle file validation using the <code>validate</code> prop, passing appropriate validation functions to check the file before processing it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the file input is keyboard-accessible and focusable for improved accessibility.</li>
  <li>Provide proper error messages when validation fails to help users correct issues with their file uploads.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the <code>accept</code> attribute in <code>inputProps</code> to restrict the file types that can be uploaded.
  </li>
  <li>Validate the file size and type before processing it.</li>
  <li>Provide meaningful error messages when a file fails validation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Don'ts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Avoid allowing unrestricted file types unless absolutely necessary, as this can pose security risks.
  </li>
  <li>Don't forget to handle validation to ensure files meet the expected criteria.</li>
</ul>
