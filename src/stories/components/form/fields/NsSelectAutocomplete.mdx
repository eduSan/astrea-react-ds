<h1>Autocomplete select</h1>
<p>
  The Feedback component is a versatile React component designed to display
  notifications or alerts to users within a web application. It serves as a
  user-friendly way to convey important information, warnings, or updates to
  users in real-time.
</p>
<Primary />

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
  The component employs an input field that dynamically filters a list of
  options based on the user's input. As the user types, the list of suggestions
  updates in real-time, presenting matching options. Users can either select an
  option from the filtered list or continue typing to refine the suggestions
  further.
</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Keep the suggestion list concise:</strong> Provide a manageable
    number of suggestions to prevent overwhelming the user with choices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provide clear and relevant options:</strong> Ensure that the
    suggested options are relevant and easy to understand for users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consider keyboard accessibility:</strong> Ensure that users can
    navigate through the suggestions and select options using keyboard controls.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  The Autocomplete Select component aims to be accessible by following best
  practices for accessibility:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Keyboard navigation:</strong> Users can navigate through the
    suggestion list using keyboard arrow keys and select an option using the
    Enter key.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Screen reader support:</strong> The component ensures that options
    are announced to screen readers and maintains focus appropriately for
    accessibility.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
  Use the AutoComplete select when users need to select options from a large
  dataset, search through extensive lists, or when the available options change
  dynamically. Its ability to provide a streamlined user experience, especially
  when dealing with sizable or frequently changing datasets, makes it a valuable
  choice in many applications and forms.
