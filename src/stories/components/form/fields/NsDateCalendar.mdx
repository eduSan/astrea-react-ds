<h1>Date calendar</h1>

  The Date Calendar Input is a React component designed to provide users with an
  intuitive way to select dates through a calendar interface. It offers a
  user-friendly experience for inputting and selecting dates within a web
  application.

<Primary />

<h3>How it works</h3>

  The Date Calendar Input allows users to either type a date manually or click
  on an input field to open a calendar view. Users can then navigate through the
  calendar to select a specific date. It usually provides features like month
  and year navigation, selectable dates, and the ability to highlight the
  current date.


<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the calendar input is easily accessible and visible to users.</li>
  <li>
    Provide clear instructions or hints on how to use the calendar input for
    date selection.
  </li>
  <li>
    Handle different date formats and localize date representations for
    international users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider using an accessible design that accommodates keyboard navigation
    and screen reader users.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

  To ensure accessibility, the Date Calendar Input should adhere to the
  following guidelines:

<ul>
  <li>Use semantic HTML elements where possible.</li>
  <li>
    Implement ARIA attributes for screen readers and assistive technologies.
  </li>
  <li>Ensure proper keyboard navigation for users who may not use a mouse.</li>
  <li>
    Provide text alternatives for non-text content such as icons or visual cues.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

  The decision to use a Date Calendar Input versus a simple Date Input depends
  on various factors related to user experience, design, and functionality
  requirements within your application. Here are scenarios where using a Date
  Calendar Input might be more suitable:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> If your application requires a
    more user-friendly and intuitive way for users to select dates, a Date
    Calendar Input provides a visual calendar interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Visual Representation:</strong> If your application benefits from a
    visual representation of dates, such as highlighting weekends, holidays, or
    unavailable dates, a Date Calendar Input can offer a clearer view and
    understanding of date options.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reducing Input Errors:</strong> Calendar inputs can help prevent
    input errors for date formats, especially when users come from different
    regions where date formats vary.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mobile-Friendly Interactions:</strong> Calendar inputs can offer
    improved usability on touch devices by providing larger touch targets for
    selecting dates.
  </li>
</ul>

However, a simple Date Input might be more suitable in scenarios where:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Space Constraints:</strong> If the available space for input is
    limited, a simple Date Input might be more practical than a calendar view,
    which could occupy more screen real estate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Specific Date Entry:</strong> When users are expected to input
    specific dates without the need for visual representation or a range of
    selectable dates, a Date Input might be more straightforward.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Simplicity and Minimalism:</strong> For applications that prioritize
    simplicity and minimalism in their design, a Date Input might align better
    with the overall UI.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Input Precision:</strong> In cases where users are required to input
    time in addition to date, a simple Date Input might be extended to include
    time selection while keeping the input field clean and focused.
  </li>
</ul>


  In summary, choose a Date Calendar Input when the user experience benefits
  from visual date selection, complex date range selections, or when reducing
  input errors is crucial. Conversely, opt for a simple Date Input when space
  constraints, specific date entry, or minimalistic design are the primary
  considerations. Ultimately, the choice should align with the specific needs
  and usability of your application.
