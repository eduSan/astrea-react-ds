<h1>Button</h1>
<p>The Button component is a reusable UI element used to trigger actions or events when clicked. It serves as an interactive element within the user interface, commonly employed to initiate actions such as form submissions, navigation, or other user interactions.</p>
<Primary />

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The Button component encapsulates a basic HTML &lt;button&gt; element and provides additional features like customizable styles, event handling, and accessibility attributes. It can be easily customised through its props to suit various design requirements and functionalities.</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Consistency: Maintain consistent styling and behaviour of buttons throughout the application.</li>
  <li>Clear Labels: Use descriptive and concise labels to communicate the action or purpose of the button.</li>
  <li>Accessibility: Ensure proper accessibility attributes (like aria-label, aria-describedby, etc.) for users relying on assistive technologies.</li>
	<li>Responsive Design: Create responsive button styles to accommodate different device sizes and user interactions.</li>
	<li>Testability: Implement testing strategies to verify button functionality across different scenarios.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Props</h3>
<Controls />
<p>text</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>The Button component is designed with accessibility in mind. To ensure optimal accessibility:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use meaningful text or labels (ariaLabel) that describe the button's purpose for screen readers.</li>
  <li>Enable keyboard focus styling (:focus) for easy navigation and usability.</li>
	<li>Ensure sufficient color contrast and visual cues to aid users with visual impairments.</li>
	<li>Disable or enable the button based on context, indicating its state to assistive technologies.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Place buttons in prominent positions based on their importance and action. Primary action buttons should stand out more compared to secondary or tertiary buttons.</p>
