<h1>Feedback</h1>
<p>
  The Feedback component is a versatile React component designed to display
  notifications or alerts to users within a web application. It serves as a
  user-friendly way to convey important information, warnings, or updates to
  users in real-time.
</p>
<Primary />

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
  The Feedback component operates by accepting incoming messages or
  notifications as props and displaying them to the user in a visually appealing
  manner. It typically appears as a small pop-up or banner that can be
  customised in terms of appearance, duration, and positioning on the screen.
</p>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Keep messages concise: Ensure that the notifications displayed through the
    Notifier component are brief and easy to understand at a glance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid overwhelming users: Use notifications judiciously to avoid bombarding
    users with excessive alerts, maintaining a balance between informative and
    intrusive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Customise for context: Tailor the appearance and behaviour of the Notifier
    component based on the application's design and the urgency of the message.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
  To ensure accessibility, consider the following points while using the
  Notifier component:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Keyboard accessibility: Make sure users can dismiss notifications using
    keyboard controls or provide an accessible way to close the notification.
  </li>
  <li>
    Screen reader compatibility: Ensure that the content of the notifications is
    accessible to screen readers by providing proper ARIA attributes and
    semantic markup.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Balance Information Delivery: Ensure that notifications strike a balance
    between informing users and not interrupting their workflow excessively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Placement and Timing: Test and determine optimal positions and timing for
    notifications to appear, considering user attention and workflow.
  </li>
</ul>
